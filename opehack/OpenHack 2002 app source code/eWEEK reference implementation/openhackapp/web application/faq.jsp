			<h2>eWEEK eXcellence Awards Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

			<p><i>Entries are arranged with most recent additions listed first.</i></p>

			<p><b>Q. Will customer references remain confidential?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b> Yes, we will keep them internal unless the customer agrees to have their name published.</p>

			<p><b>Q. Where should I send my check?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b>If you indicated you would pay the entry fee by check, please mail a check for $100.00 to:<br>
				<br>
				eWEEK<br>
				10 President's Landing<br>
				Medford, MA<br>
				02155<br>
				USA<br>
				ATTN: eXcellence Awards<br>
				<br>
				Please make the check payable to eWEEK.<br>
				<br>
				We must receive the check by <b>Dec. 31, 2001</b> or your entry will invalid.
			</p>

			<p><b>Q. What do I do if I want to submit entries from different companies?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b>You can do this. Use the "Register another company" option on the site homepage. You will need to pay a new $100 entry fee for <b>each</b> company you register.</p>

			<p><b>Q. Can a company's entries compete with each other?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b>Yes, if these entries are similar enough to be placed into the same category of product or service by eWEEK judges. There can only be one winner in each category.</p>

			<p><b>Q. Last year we had to enter products into particular categories. Has the process changed this year?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b>Yes. We decided that the program would be more flexible, easier to enter and more valuable to the IT community if eXcellence Awards judges placed entered products into categories after the submission deadline. We are considering all enterprise-class products and services released in 2001--that is, products and services released in 2001 that affect the enterprise and enterprise IT managers and/or are deployed across the enterprise.</p>

			<p><b>Q. You say that eXcellence Awards entries will be judged by a team of eWEEK Labs analysts and eWEEK Corporate Partners. Who are the Corporate Partners?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b>Go to <a href="http://corporatepartners.net/Current_Partners/current_partners.html">corporatepartners.net/Current_Partners/current_partners.html</a> for a listing of the members of eWEEK's Corporate Partner advisory board.</p>

			<p><b>Q. Can I save partially completed entry submission forms?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b>No, please submit the whole form at once. We recommend typing your entry into your computer, saving it, and then cutting-and-pasting it into the Web site when you are ready to submit it.</p>

			<p><b>Q. Will the customer references we supply to you be kept confidential?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b>Customer references will be kept confidential by default. After finalists and winners are chosen, eWEEK may ask to publish information about the specific application of a winning product or service for an eXcellence Awards special report planned for March 2002. However, at that point we will also honor confidentiality requests, and such requests (or, for that matter, approval to publish customer references) will have no effect on the judging process.</p>

			<p><b>Q. Do we have to submit actual product?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b>No. We do not actually need to see product because we are requiring customer/user references to determine whether the entered product or service does what's claimed, and to assess its performance, capability and reliability. The role of the judges is to identify significant contributions in terms of whether the product or service has a novel and strategic vision, further qualified by the references as to whether it fulfills that mission.</p>

			<p><b>Q. Can I sign in using my account from last year's site (the year 2000 awards site)?</b></p>
			<p><b>A. </b>No -- you should create a new account for this year. We changed databases this year and so are starting fresh.</p>
