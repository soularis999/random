			<h2>eWEEK eXcellence awards reflect new IT demands</h2>

			<p>
				The eWEEK eXcellence awards will give enterprise IT professionals their 
				most comprehensive benchmark for assessing products and services that 
				enhance e-business performance.
			</p>

			<h3>Entry process</h3>

			<p>
				Vendors are invited to enter an unlimited number of products and services 
				announced in the year 2001. eWEEK Labs analysts and eWEEK Corporate Partners 
				will apply their technical and real-world expertise to judge the products. 
				As a result, the eWEEK eXcellence Awards will direct organizations to the 
				products and services that will allow them to establish and maintain 
				enterprise leadership.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each vendor will be charged a non-tax deductible entry fee of $100.00 (no 
				matter the number of products or services entered).
			<p>

			<h3>Selection day</h3>

			<p>
				The eWEEK eXcellence program spans the gamut of IT concerns; after all 
				entries are received, the judges will place products and services into 
				categories that reflect their role in an e-business enterprise.
			</p>
			<p>
				We promise our readers a compelling list of winners when we announce the 
				2001 award recipients on Feb. 21, 2002.
