# LEVEL DEFINITION
# ================
#
# BASIC FORMAT:
# -------------
#  A level is described as a 25x18 grid of tiles.  Each of the 18 rows
#  are defined on a separate line using the following syntax:
#
#     Y  |ROW_DATA
#
#  In this syntax, "Y" is ignored but serves as a comment to easily 
#  determine which row is currently being defined.  The "|" character
#  is a mandatory delimiter to indicate where the row data begins.
#  ROW_DATA represents a string of 0-25 characters describing
#  each of the 25 tiles in the current row.
#
#  If less than 25 characters are specified in ROW_DATA, it is assumed
#  those tiles are empty.  If more than 25 characters are specified,
#  the extra characters are simply ignored.
#
#  If less than 18 rows are specified in the level file, it is assumed
#  those rows are empty.  If more than 18 rows are specified.  The extra
#  rows are simple ignored.
#
#  Lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments and are therefore
#  ignored.
#
#  The following characters can be used to represent level entities:
#     ' '   Empty Tile
#     'G'   Grass Terrain
#     'S'   Sticky Terrain
#     'F'   Flying AI
#     'W'   Walking AI
#     'T'   Collectable Token
#     'P'   Player
#
#  A level MUST include a player starting location (P) and at least
#  one token (T).  If both of these requirements are not met, then
#  a default level will be loaded instead.
#
#
# BASIC FORMAT WITH AI DIRECTIONS:
# --------------------------------
#  When AI is defined in a level, ROW_DATA can include additional
#  information to specify their initial travel direction using
#  the following syntax:
#
#     Y  |ROW_DATA                 |AI_DATA
#
#  In this syntax, everything leading up to the second '|' is processed with
#  exactly the same rules as described above in the BASIC FORMAT.  However,
#  when the second '|' is detected, it assumes all subsequent data is
#  directional information for the AI on the current row.
#
#  AI_DATA is represented as a sequence of numbers [0-3], each corresponding
#  to AI defined on the current line:
#     '0'   Left     (Counter-clockwise for Flying AI)
#     '1'   Right    (Counter-clockwise for Flying AI)
#     '2'   Up       (Counter-clockwise for Flying AI)
#     '3'   Down     (Counter-clockwise for Flying AI)
#     '4'   Left     (Clockwise for Flying AI)
#     '5'   Right    (Clockwise for Flying AI)
#     '6'   Up       (Clockwise for Flying AI)
#     '7'   Down     (Clockwise for Flying AI)
#
#  If more directions are specified than AI defined on a given line, then
#  extra directions are ignored.
#
#  If more directions are specified than AI defined in the entire level, then
#  extra directions are ignored.
