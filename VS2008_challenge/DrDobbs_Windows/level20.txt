# LEVEL DEFINITION
#
#  A level is described as a 25x18 grid of tiles.  Each of the 18 rows
#  are defined on a separate line using the following syntax:
#
#     Y  |ROW_DATA
#
#  In this syntax, "Y" is ignored but serves as a comment to easily 
#  determine which row is currently being defined.  The "|" character
#  is a mandatory delimiter to indicate where the row data begins.
#  ROW_DATA represents a string of 0-25 characters describing
#  each of the 25 tiles in the current row.
#
#  If less than 25 characters are specified in ROW_DATA, it is assumed
#  those tiles are empty.  If more than 25 characters are specified,
#  the extra characters are simply ignored.
#
#  If less than 18 rows are specified in the level file, it is assumed
#  those rows are empty.  If more than 18 rows are specified.  The extra
#  rows are simple ignored.
#
#  Lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments and are therefore
#  ignored.
#
#  The following characters can be used to represent level entities:
#     ' '   Empty Tile
#     'G'   Grass Terrain
#     'S'   Sticky Terrain
#     'F'   Flying AI
#     'W'   Walking AI
#     'T'   Collectable Token
#     'P'   Player
#
#  A level MUST include a player starting location (P) and at least
#  one token (T).  If both of these requirements are not met, then
#  a default level will be loaded instead.
